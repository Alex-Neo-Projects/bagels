# Esbuild + React + Bun = ❤️

This is a *very* simple starter project that uses [Esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) + [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for a react repo. 

## Why use this? 

Esbuild is significantly faster than the bundler (webpack) that's used by [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (see: [ESBuild benchmarks](https://esbuild.github.io/)).

And bun is signficantly faster than npm/yarn for installing packages.

So, this provides a faster dev experience than create react app.

#### What's a bundler?
I recommend asking chatGPT about it. That's how I came to understand it and why it matters.

## Why'd you make this repo? 

I just wanted to try out using react from scratch. Since I always use create react app/nextJS/vite I didn't actually know how to setup a react project without them. 

Also we were having webpack problems and instead of solving it by learning about webpack I made this.
